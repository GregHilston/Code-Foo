The goal of these coding challenges is for you to approach these however you'd like and to have us all communicate. Some people will write their answers in languages they know very well, others will try something completely new out. Regardless of your approach, post your solutions as a top level reply below.

Reddit's formatting can be a little wonky, basically add four spaces to every line of code to get a nice looking code format applied.

Please comment on people's solutions. Ask why they did X, point out potential improvements.

Additionally, please list what language your solution is coded in.

You're more then welcome to pull request your solution into the following [Github Repo](https://github.com/GregHilston/Code-Foo)

Feel free to hit me up with any comments or questions on here, Slack or Hipchat. Happy coding!

# Challenge

Given a pattern and a string str, find if str follows the same pattern.

Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in str.

_Note: You may assume pattern contains only lowercase letters, and str contains lowercase letters separated by a single space._

You can either copy and paste the Strings into your function call, or look at the input files in the [repo](https://github.com/GregHilston/Code-Foo/tree/master/Challenges/challenge_21_word_pattern).

## Examples

### Example 1

>Input: pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat dog"

>Output: true

### Example 2

>Input:pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat fish"

>Output: false

### Example 3

> Input: pattern = "aaaa", str = "dog cat cat dog"

> Output: false

### Example 4

> Input: pattern = "abba", str = "dog dog dog dog"

>Output: false
