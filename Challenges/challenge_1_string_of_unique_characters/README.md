The goal of these coding challenges is for you to approach these however you'd like and to have us all communicate. Some people will write their answers in languages they know very well, others will try something completely new out. Regardless of your approach, post your solutions as a top level reply below.

Reddit's formatting can be a little wonky, basically add four spaces to every line of code to get a nice looking code format applied.

Please comment on people's solutions. Ask why they did X, point out potential improvements.

Feel free to hit me up with any comments or questions on here, Slack or Hipchat. Happy coding!

# Challenge
Implement a function called `hasUniqueCharacters` that takes a `String` and determines if the input has all unique characters. Return `True` if all characters are unique, otherwise `False`.

Input will be limited to alphabet characters and spaces. Treat all alphabet characters as lowercase and ignore spaces when determining unique characters.

# Examples
`hasUniqueCharacters("JFK got my VHS PC and XLR web quiz")` => `True`

`hasUniqueCharacters("abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz")` => `True`

`hasUniqueCharacters("")` => `True`

`hasUniqueCharacters("aabc")` => `False`

`hasUniqueCharacters("aa")` => `False`

`hasUniqueCharacters("aA")` => `False`


# Optional Bonus 1
What if you cannot use additional data structures? Basically only use the given String and its List representation.


# Optional Bonus 2
Write unit tests for your function.


# Optional Bonus 3
What is the big O of your solution?


# Optional Bonus 4
Discuss your time/memory tradeoff?
