The goal of these coding challenges is for you to approach these however you'd like and to have us all communicate. Some people will write their answers in languages they know very well, others will try something completely new out. Regardless of your approach, post your solutions as a top level reply below.

Reddit's formatting can be a little wonky, basically add four spaces to every line of code to get a nice looking code format applied.

Please comment on people's solutions. Ask why they did X, point out potential improvements.

Additionally, please list what language your solution is coded in.

You're more then welcome to pull request your solution into the following [Github Repo](https://github.com/GregHilston/Code-Foo)

Feel free to hit me up with any comments or questions on here, Slack or Hipchat. Happy coding!

# Challenge

Given an input of length 9 which contains only the following characters, `o`, `x`, or `-`.

Where `o` represents one player's input, `x` represents the other's and `-` represents a blank space.

Determine if the board has any winners. You can do this however you'd like. One way would be to write two functions:

`hasPlayerXWon`

`hasPlayerOWon`

both of which would return a bool. There are many other ways to go about this, feel free to do this however you'd like.

_Please note, there will be additional challenges that build off of this one._

## Examples

[Find Input 1 Here](https://github.com/GregHilston/Code-Foo/blob/master/Challenges/challenge_16_tic_tac_toe_part_1/input_1.txt)

With expected output:

No winners.

[Find Input 2 Here](https://github.com/GregHilston/Code-Foo/blob/master/Challenges/challenge_16_tic_tac_toe_part_1/input_2.txt)

With expected output:

X is the winner

[Find Input 3 Here](https://github.com/GregHilston/Code-Foo/blob/master/Challenges/challenge_16_tic_tac_toe_part_1/input_3.txt)

With expected output:

X is the winner
