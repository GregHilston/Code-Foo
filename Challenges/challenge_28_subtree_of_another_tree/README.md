_I suggest sorting this thread by *New* to see the most recent submissions_

The goal of these coding challenges is for you to approach these however you'd like and to have us all communicate. Some people will write their answers in languages they know very well, others will try something completely new out. Regardless of your approach, post your solutions as a top level reply below.

Reddit's formatting can be a little wonky, basically add four spaces to every line of code to get a nice looking code format applied.

Please comment on people's solutions. Ask why they did X, point out potential improvements.

Additionally, please list what language your solution is coded in.

You're more then welcome to pull request your solution into the following [Github Repo](https://github.com/GregHilston/Code-Foo)

Feel free to hit me up with any comments or questions on here, Slack or Hipchat. Happy coding!

# Challenge

Given two non-empty binary trees s and t, check whether tree t has exactly the same structure and node values with a subtree of s. A subtree of s is a tree consists of a node in s and all of this node's descendants. The tree s could also be considered as a subtree of itself.

_Check `Acknowledgement` section for link to Leet Code, to get the iput for your desired language._

## Example 1

Given tree s:

         3
        / \
       4   5
      / \
     1   2

Given tree t:

       4
      / \
     1   2

Return `true`, because t has the same structure and node values with a subtree of s.

## Example 2

Given tree s:

         3
        / \
       4   5
      / \
     1   2
        /
       0

Given tree t:

       4
      / \
     1   2

Return `false`.
