Language: Python    

I wrote this week's in Python, using th Pillow library known as `Pil`. I've always wanted to _try_ to use some input String to generate a seed. I know there's 1000's of ways to do this with tons of written ways online, but I decided to just wing this. The code is not very good, but it allows each String to generate their own special square!
