The goal of these coding challenges is for you to approach these however you'd like and to have us all communicate. Some people will write their answers in languages they know very well, others will try something completely new out. Regardless of your approach, post your solutions as a top level reply below.

Reddit's formatting can be a little wonky, basically add four spaces to every line of code to get a nice looking code format applied.

Please comment on people's solutions. Ask why they did X, point out potential improvements.

Additionally, please list what language your solution is coded in.

You're more then welcome to pull request your solution into the following [Github Repo](https://github.com/GregHilston/Code-Foo)

Feel free to hit me up with any comments or questions on here, Slack or Hipchat. Happy coding!

# Challenge

You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

_Note: Given n will be a positive integer._

## Example 1

**Input**: 2
**Output**: 2

**Explanation**: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps

_Note: You do not have to print the explanations, but you may if you choose_

## Example 2

**Input**: 3
**Output**: 3

**Explanation**: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step

_Note: You do not have to print the explanations, but you may if you choose_

## Commentary

You are more than welcome to post your solution on Leet Code. This will give you feedback and tips on how to improve your answer, along with telling you how quickly your execution was. If that interests you, post how long _in ms_, your solution took to run. We can compare solutions of like languages. If this doesn't interest you, than completely ignore the fact that this challenge came from Leet Code.
