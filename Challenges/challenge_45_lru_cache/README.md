The goal of these coding challenges is for you to approach these however you'd like and to have us all communicate. Some people will write their answers in languages they know very well, others will try something completely new out. Regardless of your approach, post your solutions as a top level reply below.

Reddit's formatting can be a little wonky, basically add four spaces to every line of code to get a nice looking code format applied.

Please comment on people's solutions. Ask why they did X, point out potential improvements.

Additionally, please list what language your solution is coded in.

You're more then welcome to pull request your solution into the following [Github Repo](https://github.com/GregHilston/Code-Foo)

Feel free to hit me up with any comments or questions on here, Slack or Hipchat. Happy coding!

# Challenge

Design and implement a data structure for [Least Recently Used (LRU) cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#LRU). It should support the following operations: get and put.

get(key) - Get the value (will always be positive) of the key if the key exists in the cache, otherwise return -1.
put(key, value) - Set or insert the value if the key is not already present. When the cache reached its capacity, it should invalidate the least recently used item before inserting a new item.

The cache is initialized with a positive capacity.

# Example


    LRUCache cache = new LRUCache( 2 /* capacity */ );

    cache.put(1, 1);
    cache.put(2, 2);
    cache.get(1);       // returns 1
    cache.put(3, 3);    // evicts key 2
    cache.get(2);       // returns -1 (not found)
    cache.put(4, 4);    // evicts key 1
    cache.get(1);       // returns -1 (not found)
    cache.get(3);       // returns 3
    cache.get(4);       // returns 4
