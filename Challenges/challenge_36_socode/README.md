The goal of these coding challenges is for you to approach these however you'd like and to have us all communicate. Some people will write their answers in languages they know very well, others will try something completely new out. Regardless of your approach, post your solutions as a top level reply below.

Reddit's formatting can be a little wonky, basically add four spaces to every line of code to get a nice looking code format applied.

Please comment on people's solutions. Ask why they did X, point out potential improvements.

Additionally, please list what language your solution is coded in.

You're more then welcome to pull request your solution into the following [Github Repo](https://github.com/GregHilston/Code-Foo)

Feel free to hit me up with any comments or questions on here, Slack or Hipchat. Happy coding!

# Challenge

This "challenge" is a little different. There isn't going to be an end goal, rather you're going to be asked to be creative.

I'll have a single file in the folder called `socode.js`

## Loose Rules

- Add a function with your github name as its name.
- Your function can do anything and everything, as long as it finishes in a reasonable amount of time. No infinite loops, please.
- Once your function is written, you can call it from anywhere else in the already existing execution chain.
- Never entirely delete anyone else's function. Edit it if needed.
- codeFoo() should be the last executing function
