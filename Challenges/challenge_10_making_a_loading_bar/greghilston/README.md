This is my very first program that involves HTMl, CSS and JS. I would very much appreciate any feedback on my `script.js`.

I did not complete the optional bonus portion of the challenge. I originally did not have global variables, but couldn't get `setInterval` to be called with a variable, so I gave up.

Thank you!
