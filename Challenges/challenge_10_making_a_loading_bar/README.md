The goal of these coding challenges is for you to approach these however you'd like and to have us all communicate. Some people will write their answers in languages they know very well, others will try something completely new out. Regardless of your approach, post your solutions as a top level reply below.

Reddit's formatting can be a little wonky, basically add four spaces to every line of code to get a nice looking code format applied.

Please comment on people's solutions. Ask why they did X, point out potential improvements.

Additionally, please list what language your solution is coded in.

You're more then welcome to pull request your solution into the following [Github Repo](https://github.com/GregHilston/Code-Foo)

Feel free to hit me up with any comments or questions on here, Slack or Hipchat. Happy coding!

# Challenge

Your goal is to create a loading bar, using an input field to customize how many seconds it takes to load. This challenge is a little less open-ended than previous ones, as you'll be forking the repl below and using JavaScript for your solution. However, this challenge should be pretty good introduction to Javascript for those who are unfamiliar with it, so have fun!

Fork this repl: [https://repl.it/@dSharp/MakingALoadingBar](https://repl.it/@dSharp/MakingALoadingBar)

(You can fork it simply by clicking the link and typing something in any of the files)

For guidance, simply uncomment the "theanswer.js" script at the bottom of the index.html file, click "Run", and play around with the output.

As far as your submission goes, you are welcome to post the contents of your script.js file in the comments, or the link to your repl itself so we can see it in action!

# Hint

This challenge will require the use of onclick events, functions firing on an interval, and retrieving the value of an input field. If you need help with any of these, take a look at "theanswer.js" and see how it works.

# Input Description

In the "Load Time" input field, you'll put how many seconds you would like the loading bar to take, using Integer or Real Number (Floating Point Number, or Decimal) format.

# Output Description

When you click the "Reset Loading Bar" button, the grey bar underneath should start to fill up with a lime green progress bar, taking as long as the input you gave to fill.

# Optional Bonus 1

While the bar is loading, output its current progress in percentage format in the center, like this:
